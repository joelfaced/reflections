When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration and to be able to work from anywhere. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To be certain th at the changes made are the changes you want to commit.
